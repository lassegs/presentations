# Group project
Proposal due: 12 October at 18:00.

Project due: 15 December at 14:00.

Purpose: To demonstrate skills you have developed during the course.

__Format:__

• 2-3 people per group

• Identify a research question related to Oslo.

• Collect and edit relevant data.

• Use ArcGis (or other software) to manipulate, analyse, and present results.

• Write up work in a formal report.

## Intensive Data
Data independent of the spatial units (e.g., population density, percentages); data that has been normalized in some fashion.

Spatially intensive data are things like rates, densities and proportions, which can be thought of conceptually as field data that is averaged over an area. Though the UK's 60 million inhabitants occupy an area of about 240,000 km2, and the population density is therefore about 250/km2, arbitrary halves of equal area would not also both have the same population density.

## Extensive data

Data dependent on the spatial units (e.g., population totals)

Spatially extensive data are things like populations. The population of the UK might be 60 million, but it would not be accurate to arbitrarily cut the UK into two halves of equal area and say that the population of each half of the UK is 30 million.
