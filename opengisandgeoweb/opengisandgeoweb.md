# Open GIS and the geoeweb

A presentation to the tune of the [Cantina theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCGPt3XFxJk). 

This is the story of the state of web mapping from a free software and open source perspective. The story is rendered in typical Star Wars style. For the lulz.

<div style="font-weight: 800">
In a galaxy not so far away, in neither time nor space...

```

 I explore the origins of the hacker culture,including prehistory among the Real
 Programmers, the glory days of the MIT hackers, and how the early ARPAnet nurtured
 the first network nation.

 I describe the early rise and eventual stagnation of Unix, the new hope from
 Finland, and how *the last true hacker* became the next generation's patriarch. I
 sketch the way Linux and the mainstreaming of the Internet brought the hacker
 culture from the fringes of public consciousness to its current prominence.

Note:
why should you go down this rabbit hole.
A history of digital mapping. One that tries to lay out a map of mapping. A given here,
is Bacon's statement that 'knowledge is power'. When we create maps, make visualizations,
or even just present, we are in fact creating new worlds. So be fully aware

Antropocene

Starts in a unimportant wasteland

It's the anthropocene, or rather the Mantropocene.

# Free software

Note: 
There are many who don't see free software as a critique of the production process of what is. 
That is fine. This god has many faces, and fits into many narratives.

* 1960s - [CGIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Geographic_Information_System). Rare computers.
* 1970s - Academics and pioneers. GRASS. Not so rare anymore. 
* 1980s - Spatial database breakthroughs and PCs. Diversification.
* 1990s - Mapinfo. Don't forget how you found this out - 1998 [google](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=history+of+gis+filetype%3Apdf&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C47).
* 2000s - ESRI, QGIS, Web 1.0 -> Web 2.0.
* 2010s - Web 2.0 maps.
* 2020s - 

Note:
Canadian grandmaster Roger Tomlinson / IBM --> geogratis
GRASS is freely available, and very usable together with QGIS.

1980s saw the breakthrough of 

Norge var tidlig på ARPAnet, da vi hadde seismiske stasjoner for måling av atombombesprenginger i Sovjet.

### Alternative view

A whole fucking bunch of map based software by the 2000s.

---

ArcGIS is just another GIS. 

---

Standardization takes work and time.

What exactly is it ArcGIS does?

* What?
* How?
* Why?

---

<iframe data-src="//giphy.com/embed/Gt0zE0HOMkTCg" width="800" height="500" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

Note:
Let's just have look at it. What do we see when we use it?
Here I'm offering my shoulders to stand on and see further,
but you'll have to overcome my shortcomings.

Open, visualize, analyse and store

* ##~~But What?~~
<small> * Big, bad question</small>
* Let's start with <big>How?</big>

---

 ##Opens a spatial database
  * Connects through storage or network
  * Recognizes and indexes information
  * Loads up relevant data from storage to RAM (working memory)
---
 ##Visualizes 
  * Coordinates and layers
  * Styles
  * Handles user interface
---
 ## Analyses
 * Measurements and overlays
 * Spatial correlation (Moran's I, etc.)
 * Spatial regression 
 * Network analysis
 * MANY MANY MORE
---

 ## Stores
 * To image
 * As file locally
 * To database remotely
 * As .pdf (to the printer)	

---
Ok, so it opens, visualizes, analyzes, stores what?
<h2>What are we mapping?</h2>
# Data?

Weakness

* Desktops, desktops everywhere.
* Stiff maps

* Strong user/developer divide

Note:
Omnious desktop fucking metaphor, the violent real abstraction of the desktop.

## Database

## [Leaflet](http://www.leafletjs.com)


## [Openlayers](http://www.openlayers.org)

Note:

This is a note
---

## ```<div id="map">```

Note:
Both leaflet and openlayers depend on this logic: A "map" div places a map element on the web page.
---

```
<html> <head> <title>Funky title</title> </head>
<body>
	<h1>Funky header</h1>
	<div id="map" style="width: 100%, height: 400px"></div>
		<script>
  		new ol.Map({
    			layers: [
      			new ol.layer.Tile({source: new ol.source.OSM()})
			 ],
   			 view: new ol.View({
     			 center: [0, 0],

 			   }),
  		  target: 'map'

## HTML

Hypertext Markup Language is used to structure content for web browsers.

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Page Title</h1>
        <p>This is a really interesting paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
---

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets styles the visuals of HTML sites.
```
body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
}
```
---
## Javascript

Javascript allows us to control and change the web site after its loaded.
