A tour down the rabbit hole of data science...

...and our complex webs and layers of infrastructure...

where we briefy visit the hackers...


---

...the guards...

---

...And our heroes.

---

It's not a new history...

```

I explore the origins of the hacker culture,including prehistory among the Real
 Programmers, the glory days of the MIT hackers, and how the early ARPAnet nurtured
 the first network nation.

I describe the early rise and eventual stagnation of Unix, the new hope from
 Finland, and how *the last true hacker* became the next generation's patriarch. I
 sketch the way Linux and the mainstreaming of the Internet brought the hacker
 culture from the fringes of public consciousness to its current prominence.

 ##Visualizes data
  * Coordinates and layers
  * Styles
  * Handles user interface
---
 ## Analyses data
 * Measurements and overlays
 * Spatial correlation (moran's I)
 * Spatial regression 
 * Network analysis
 * MANY MANY MORE
---

 ## Stores data
 * As file locally
