1) The presentation title (<h1> element)

2) The presentation abstract: a paragraph or two summarizing what the presentation is about – this is the same abstract that I send to conference organizers when I submit the talk

3) A call-to-action to “View Slides”: a link to the GitHub Pages version of the presentation

4) Presentation History: a list of places this presentation has been given, including relevant Joind.in links. This can be immensely useful when submitting a repeat talk, as you can show the types of conferences who have already said “yes” to the talk and link to positive reviews the talk has received.

5) Additional notes: this section isn’t always necessary, but it’s often helpful for both my audience and myself to keep track of good resources related to the topic.
